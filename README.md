# metrics

collecting OSS vitess project metrics

This public repository serves as a placeholder for some dev/build metrics of OSS [Vitess](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess).

These are not deployment performance metrics but rather tracking metrics for:

- Builds
- Contributions
- etc.

At this time this repo is experimental.
